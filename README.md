# MW2MapScambler
A personal project to scramble a map list inside a .bat file to host a dedicated MW2 server.

It takes in four arguments, the path to the map file, the path to the .bat file to be overwritten, and pre and post map list server config.  
If your pre and/or post map configs contain `"` please replace them with `\"` or the program will not read the arguments correctly.
